Create a GitHub account

In this lesson, you'll be sharing changes on GitHub, so you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, you can create an account by visiting github.com and clicking "Sign up for GitHub".

When you're asked to choose a plan, you can choose a free plan, since we won't be using any of the paid features in this course.

Set up Password Caching

Every time you send changes to GitHub via the command line, you'll need to type your password to prove that you have permission to modify the repository. This can get annoying quickly, so many people like to set up password caching, which will let you type your password once and have it auto-filled on that computer in the future. To do this, follow the instructions here. If you're using Windows and you followed our Git installation instructions earlier, you're using msysgit, so you can follow the instructions for msysgit.
